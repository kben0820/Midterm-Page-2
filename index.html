    6 months later, the Phantom hasn't been seen or heard from, Christine is engaged to Raoul, and everything seems to be going just right for now...

Grinning yellows
Spinning reds...
Masquerade!

Astound you!"

    "Why so silent, good Messieurs?
	  <br>
  </br>
Did you think that I had left you for good?
    <br>
  </br>
Have you missed me, good Messieurs?
<br>
  </br>
I have written you an opera.."
</p>

<p class="textfour">
  "Here I bring the finished score
Don Juan Triumphant!
  <br>
  </br>
I advise you to comply
My instructions should be clear
<br>
</br>
Remember there are worse things than a shattered chandelier!"
</p>

<p class="textfive">
  The Phantom came back to show the managers his new opera called "Don Juan Triumphant" and wants them to perform it. If they don't follow his rules then they will all pay by the Phantom's wrath.
</p>

<p class="textsix">
  Then the managers get more notes about not following his orders, and Carlotta is upset that she isn't the lead soprano for the new opera show. Christine and Raoul come in and she finds out that Christine will be the lead. But she doesn't want this because she's conflicted and is confused and worried about what will happen if she doesn't do this opera since Raoul is plotting to use it as a trap to end the Phantom's reign of terror.

  Raoul: "You said yourself. he is nothing but a man..yet while he lives..he will haunt us til we're dead"
  <br>
</br>
  Christine: "Twisted every way...what answer can I give? Am I to risk my life to win the chance to live? Can I betray the man who once inspired my voice? Do I become his prey, do I have any choice? He kills without a thought, he murders all that's good..I know I can't refuse and yet I wish I could..Oh God, if I agree what horrors wait for me in this..the phantom's opera?"
</p>

<p class="texteight">
  Eventually Christine agrees and goes on with the opera "Don Juan Triumphant" where she plays as the lead Aminta in the Phantom's opera house

<p class="Aminta">
  "No thoughts within her head but thoughts of joy
  <br>
</br>
No dreams within her heart but dreams of love~!"

<p class="textnine">
  "Past the point of no return
  <br>
</br>
the final threshold"
</p>

<p class="textten">
  "The bridge is crossed
  <br>
</br>
so stand and watch it burn,
<br>
</br>
We've past the point of no return.."
</p>

<p class="texteleven">
  The opera goes wrong because the Phantom basically confesses to Christine which isn't in the show and puts the ring that's on his finger onto her own..
